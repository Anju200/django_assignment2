    <p style="font-size:25px;">
    I want to thank you for your generous gift that made my education attainable. Through your support, I have accomplished much of what I never thought possible. I am proud to say I had worked hard to be where I am, but I certainly could not have done it without your help. I am forever grateful for your generosity.</p>
    <p style="font-size:25px;">
        I can not explain how thankful and blessed that I am. I have been worried about the financial side of college, but God gave me you to help lift that burden. I hope that I can make you all proud this year since you choose to support me. I promise to do my best, work to the best of my abilities, while making you all and God proud. This is the university that God called me to attend and you helped make it possible. Once again I thank you for your support and I will see you all in the fall!
